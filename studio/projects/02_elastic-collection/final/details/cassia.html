            Cassia is a spice derived from the bark of the cassia tree, a species of Cinnamomum native to China and Southeast Asia. It is closely related to true cinnamon but has a stronger, more pungent flavor and aroma. Cassia is commonly used as a cheaper alternative to cinnamon in cooking and baking.        </p>
