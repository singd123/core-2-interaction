            Asafoetida, also known as "devil's dung" due to its strong smell, is a resinous gum derived from the roots of several species of Ferula, a perennial herb native to Iran and Afghanistan. It has been used for centuries as a culinary spice, particularly in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisines, where it adds a unique flavor to dishes.        </p>
