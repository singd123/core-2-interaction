In 2009 it was almost impossible to get your hands on a blackberry phone. - pdf


I was 5 years old then and I noticed that my father owns a phone and it was blackberry.
All i cared about was the game on it. 

One day while my father went the to kitchen, he had left his phone on the table in our living room. 
Seizing the opportunity, I quickly went and grabbed his phone, excited to finally play the game. - image 


However, I was left puzzled when I wasn’t able to reach past the home screen and into the apps section 
like my father would. It all seemed like greek to me. As I went on trying to decipher the functions of this device, 
I lost track of time and noticed my father standing at the door. - song


Scared, I quickly put his phone away and stood up, making a puppy face and apologizing before
 my father could even say a word. To my surprise he laughed and told me that All this while, 
 all I had to do was just ask him. - video
